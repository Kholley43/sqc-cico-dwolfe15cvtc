Use `./build.sh` to build CiCo and `./run.sh` to run it if using the command line. You can otherwise use your IDE to build and run CiCo.

# Module 4-7: Ticket 401 - Non-Numeric Input Filtering

## Test steps
1. Build and run CiCo.
2. Type "abcd" into the card number field.
3. Wait 11 seconds.

*  The card number field should ignore non-numeric characters. If no numeric input is provided, the field should remain empty.

# Module 5-8: Ticket 501: Add Manual Proceed Button After Scanning

## Test Steps
1. Launch the CiCo application.
2. Scan a valid card.
3. Observe the status update screen.
4. Wait for the timeout to return to the main screen.
5. Restart the application.
6. Scan a valid card.
7. Click the new "Proceed" button instead of waiting.
8. Observe the status update screen transition immediately back to the main screen.

## Expected Results
* The new "Proceed" button should allow users to bypass the timeout and return to the main screen immediately.
* If the button is not clicked, the timeout should still function as before.
